This is a fork of: https://github.com/eveem-org/panoramix.git

The goal of this fork is to maintain Panoramix in a decent shape, fix some crashes, implement missing opcodes...

For now I only plan to implement very minor (but annoying fixes). If something is too complicated to understand or would require
a non-negligible amount of time it won't be fixed.
